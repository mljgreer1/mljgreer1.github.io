	<h3>Parting</h3>
	<i>Eleni Fourtouni</i><br>
	<br>
	I wrapped my eyeballs<br>
	in soft cloth and tucked them away<br> 
	they will not look at<br>
	you again<br>
	<br>
	my two lips<br>
	I buried in the dust<br>
	now they thirst only for water<br>
	<br>
	my swift feet<br>
	rest among the cobwebs<br>
	your door is thousands of miles<br> 
	from here<br>
	<br>
	my arms<br> 
	are hidden in the snow<br>
	they can never hold you<br>
	back<br>
	<br>
	I should have parted with<br> 
	the heart<br>
	it still beats, and beats, and<br>
	beats.<br>
</p>
<p>
	<h3>Just Once</h3>
	<i>Anne Sexton</i><br>
	<br>
	Just once I knew what life was for.<br>
	In Boston, quite suddenly, I understood;<br>
	walked there along the Charles River,<br>
	watched the lights copying themselves,<br>
	all neoned and strobe-hearted, opening<br>
	their mouths as wide as opera singers;<br>
	counted the stars, my little campaigners,<br>
	my scar daisies, and knew that I walked my love<br>
	on the night green side of it and cried<br>
	my heart to the eastbound cars and cried<br>
	my heart to the westbound cars and took<br>
	my truth across a small humped bridge<br>
	and hurried my truth, the charm of it, home<br>
	and hoarded these constants into morning<br>
	only to find them gone.<br>
</p>
<p>
	<h3>Your Feet</h3>
	<i>Pablo Neruda</i><br>
	<br>
	When I cannot look at your face<br>
	I look at your feet.<br>
	<br>
	Your feet of arched bone,<br>
	your hard little feet.<br>
	<br>
	I know that they support you,<br>
	and that your gentle weight<br>
	rises upon them.<br>
	<br>
	Your waist and your breasts,<br>
	the doubled purple<br>
	of your nipples,<br>
	the sockets of your eyes<br> 
	that have just flown away,<br>
	your wide fruit mouth,<br>
	your red tresses,<br>
	my little tower.<br>
	<br>
	But I love your feet<br>
	only because they walked<br> 
	upon the earth and upon the<br>
	wind and upon the waters<br>
	until they found me.<br>
</p>
<p>
	<h3>Arguments</h3>
	<i>Lisa Suhair Majaj</i><br>
	<br>
	consider the infinite fragility of an infant’s skull,<br>
	how the bones lie soft and open<br>
	only time knitting them shut<br>
	<br>
	consider a delicate porcelain bowl<br>
	how it crushes under a single blow—<br>
	in one moment whole years disappear<br>
	<br>
	consider: beneath the din of explosions<br>
	no voice can be heard<br>
	no cry<br>
	<br>
	consider your own sky on fire<br>
	your name erased<br>
	your children’s lives “a price worth paying”<br>	
	<br>
	consider the faces you do not see<br>
	the eyes you refuse to meet<br>
	“collateral damage”<br>
	<br>
	how in these words<br>
	the world<br>
	cracks open<br>
</p>

	<h3>ghaflah – the sin of forgetfulness</h3>
	<i>Dima Hilal</i><br>
	<br>
	born by the mediterranean<br>		
	our mothers bathe us in orange-blossom water<br>
	olive trees and cedars<br>
	strain to give us shade<br>
	we come to america where they call our land<br>
	the East meaning different/dark/dirty<br>
	we soon forget<br>
	our grandmothers combed hair like ours<br>
	we wish our hair blonde our eyes and skin light<br>
	we know barbie<br>
	looks better than scheherezade<br>
	we think french makes us sophisticated so<br>
	we greet each other bonjour instead of salaam<br>
	proud of our colonizer’s tongue<br>
	we forget the Qur’an sings in arabic<br>
	 
	when we arrived<br>
	our fingernails pierced the palms of our hands<br>
	we stared at pictures of our children<br>
	eye sockets carved out by rubber bullets<br>
	on the 10 o’clock news<br>
	our brothers and sisters spit up blood and teeth<br>
	and CBS declared them “terrorists”<br>
 	
	now we turn away from bruises and broken bones<br>
	body counts and funerals<br>
	we know we cannot help anyway<br>
	we forget we once stood on the same ground<br>
	they die on<br>
	we look for the arabia packaged by the west<br>
	we escape into clubs to watch<br>
	blonde belly dancers named jasmine<br>
	sashay almost naked<br>
	we eat pasty hummous at eight dollars a plate<br>
	and tell each other<br>
	how much we miss our home<br>
</p>

	<h3>Variations on the Word Love</h3>
	<i>Margaret Atwood</i><br>
	<br>
	This is a word we use to plug<br>
	holes with. It's the right size for those warm<br>	blanks in speech, for those red heart-<br>
	shaped vacancies on the page that look nothing<br>
	like real hearts. Add lace<br>
	and you can sell<br>
	it. We insert it also in the one empty<br>
	space on the printed form<br>
	that comes with no instructions. There are whole<br>
	magazines with not much in them<br>
	but the word love, you can<br>
	rub it all over your body and you<br>
	can cook with it too. How do we know<br>
	it isn't what goes on at the cool<br>
	debaucheries of slugs under damp<br>
	pieces of cardboard? As for the weed-<br>
	seedlings nosing their tough snouts up<br>
	among the lettuces, they shout it.<br>
	Love! Love! sing the soldiers, raising<br>
	their glittering knives in salute.<br>
	<br>
	Then there's the two<br>
	of us. This word<br>
	is far too short for us, it has only<br>
	four letters, too sparse<br>
	to fill those deep bare<br>
	vacuums between the stars<br>
	that press on us with their deafness.<br>
	It's not love we don't wish<br>
	to fall into, but that fear.<br>
	this word is not enough but it will<br>
	have to do. It's a single<br>
	vowel in this metallic<br>
	silence, a mouth that says<br>
	O again and again in wonder<br>
	and pain, a breath, a finger<br>
	grip on a cliffside. You can<br>
	hokd on or let go. <br>

	<h3>Pistachio Ice Cream</h3>
	<i>Annemarie Jacir</i><br>
	<br>
	They told me the<br>
	Arabs named the stars<br>
	algol, sirius, aldebaran…<br>
	My mother’s olive-shaped eyes<br>
	sandaled feet<br>
	led me into centuries<br>
	of vast empires<br>
	forgotten treasures<br>
	Now, only ruins remain.<br>
	<br>
	This was the summer<br>
	i bathed in olive oil<br>
	and sat on the sidewalks<br>
	of Jerusalem eating<br>
	pistachio ice-cream<br>
	with the old man<br>
	whose ancient face tried<br>
	to explain to me that we fought<br>
	with our hearts and<br>
	not our heads—therefore<br>
	we would never win.<br>
	<br>
	i am dead to my tribe<br>
	i will never learn all its salty secrets<br>
	So tonight I want to sleep<br>
	with vega, deneb, altair…<br>
	because they will disappear<br>
	with the morning sun,<br>
	and only ruins remain.<br>
</p>
<p>	
	<h3>Passing Time</h3>
	<i>Maya Angelou</i><br>
	<br>
	Your skin like dawn<br>
	Mine like dusk.<br>
	<br>
	One paints the beginning<br>
	of a certain end.<br>
	<br>	
	The other, the end of a<br>
	sure beginning.
