    <h3>ghaflah – the sin of forgetfulness</h3>
    <i>Dima Hilal</i><br>
    <br>
    <span class="poem">
    born by the mediterranean<br>   
    our mothers bathe us in orange-blossom water<br>
    olive trees and cedars<br>
    strain to give us shade<br>
    we come to america where they call our land<br>
    the East meaning different/dark/dirty<br>
    we soon forget<br>
    our grandmothers combed hair like ours<br>
    we wish our hair blonde our eyes and skin light<br>
    we know barbie<br>
    looks better than scheherezade<br>
    we think french makes us sophisticated so<br>
    we greet each other bonjour instead of salaam<br>
    proud of our colonizer’s tongue<br>
    we forget the Qur’an sings in arabic<br>
    <br>
    when we arrived<br>
    our fingernails pierced the palms of our hands<br>
    we stared at pictures of our children<br>
    eye sockets carved out by rubber bullets<br>
    on the 10 o’clock news<br>
    our brothers and sisters spit up blood and teeth<br>
    and CBS declared them “terrorists”<br>
    <br>
    now we turn away from bruises and broken bones<br>
    body counts and funerals<br>
    we know we cannot help anyway<br>
    we forget we once stood on the same ground<br>
    they die on<br>
    we look for the arabia packaged by the west<br>
    we escape into clubs to watch<br>
    blonde belly dancers named jasmine<br>
    sashay almost naked<br>
    we eat pasty hummous at eight dollars a plate<br>
    and tell each other<br>
    how much we miss our home<br></span>

  <h3>Summer Solstice, New York City</h3>
  <i>Sharon Olds</i><br>
  <br>
  <span class="poem">By the end of the longest day of the year he could not stand it, <br>
  he went up the iron stairs through the roof of the building<br>
  and over the soft, tarry surface<br>
  to the edge, put one leg over the complex green tin cornice<br>
  and said if they came a step closer that was it. <br>
  Then the huge machinery of the earth began to work for his life, <br>
  the cops came in their suits blue-grey as the sky on a cloudy evening, <br>
  and one put on a bullet-proof vest, a<br>
  black shell around his own life, <br>
  life of his children's father, in case<br>
  the man was armed, and one, slung with a<br>
  rope like the sign of his bounden duty, <br>
  came up out of a hole in the top of the neighboring building<br>
  like the gold hole they say is in the top of the head, <br>
  and began to lurk toward the man who wanted to die. <br>
  The tallest cop approached him directly, <br>
  softly, slowly, talking to him, talking, talking, <br>
  while the man's leg hung over the lip of the next world<br>
  and the crowd gathered in the street, silent, and the<br>
  hairy net with its implacable grid was<br>
  unfolded near the curb and spread out and<br>
  stretched as the sheet is prepared to receive a birth. <br>
  Then they all came a little closer<br>
  where he squatted next to his death, his shirt<br>
  glowing its milky glow like something<br>
  growing in a dish at night in the dark in a lab and then<br>
  everything stopped<br>
  as his body jerked and he<br>
  stepped down from the parapet and went toward them<br>
  and they closed on him, I thought they were going to<br>
  beat him up, as a mother whose child has been<br>
  lost will scream at the child when its found, they<br>
  took him by the arms and held him up and<br>
  leaned him against the wall of the chimney and the<br>
  tall cop lit a cigarette<br>
  in his own mouth, and gave it to him, and<br>
  then they all lit cigarettes, and the<br>
  red, glowing ends burned like the<br>
  tiny campfires we lit at night<br>
  back at the beginning of the world. <br></span>

  <h3>Poem Written with Issa</h3>
  <i>Matthew Rohrer</i><br>
  <br>
  <span class="poem">A friend e-mails<br>
  how much are you<br>
  enjoying yourself? <br>
  a dripping faucet<br>
  loose cat litter<br>
  no doubt about it<br>
  a good world<br>
  is difficult I say<br>
  as if I were <br>
  tilling a field<br>
  ashamed of myself<br>
  I apologize<br>
  to the sleeping child<br></span>
