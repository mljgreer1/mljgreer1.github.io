  <h3>Double Dutch</h3>
  <i>Gregory Pardlo</i><br>
  <br>
  <span class="poem">The girls turning double-dutch<br>
  bob & weave like boxers pulling<br>
  punches, shadowing each other, <br>
  sparring across the slack cord<br>  
  casting parabolas in the air. They<br>
  whip quick as an infant’s pulse<br>
  and the jumper, before she<br>
  enters the winking, nods in time<br>
  as if she has a notion to share, <br>
  waiting her chance to speak. But she’s<br>
  anticipating the upbeat<br>
  like a bandleader counting off<br>
  the tune they are about to swing into. <br>
  The jumper stair-steps into mid-air<br>
  as if she’s jumping rope in low-gravity, <br>
  training for a lunar mission. Airborne a moment<br>
  long enough to fit a second thought in, <br>
  she looks caught in the mouth bones of a fish<br>
  as she flutter-floats into motion<br>
  like a figure in a stack of time-lapse photos<br>
  thumbed alive. Once inside, <br>
  the bells tied to her shoestrings rouse the gods<br>
  who’ve lain in the dust since the Dutch<br>
  acquired Manhattan. How she dances<br>
  patterns like a dust-heavy bee retracing<br>
  its travels in scale before the hive. How<br>
  the whole stunning contraption of girl and rope<br>
  slaps and scoops like a paddle boat. <br>
  Her misted skin arranges the light<br>
  with each adjustment and flex. Now heather-<br>
  hued, now sheen, light listing on the fulcrum<br>
  of a wrist and the bare jutted joints of elbow<br>
  and knee, and the faceted surfaces of muscle, <br>
  surfaces fracturing and reforming<br>
  like a sun-tickled sleeve of running water.<br>
  She makes jewelry of herself and garlands<br>
  the ground with shadows.<br></span>

  <h3>Summer Solstice, New York City</h3>
  <i>Sharon Olds</i><br>
  <br>
  <span class="poem">By the end of the longest day of the year he could not stand it, <br>
  he went up the iron stairs through the roof of the building<br>
  and over the soft, tarry surface<br>
  to the edge, put one leg over the complex green tin cornice<br>
  and said if they came a step closer that was it. <br>
  Then the huge machinery of the earth began to work for his life, <br>
  the cops came in their suits blue-grey as the sky on a cloudy evening, <br>
  and one put on a bullet-proof vest, a<br>
  black shell around his own life, <br>
  life of his children's father, in case<br>
  the man was armed, and one, slung with a<br>
  rope like the sign of his bounden duty, <br>
  came up out of a hole in the top of the neighboring building<br>
  like the gold hole they say is in the top of the head, <br>
  and began to lurk toward the man who wanted to die. <br>
  The tallest cop approached him directly, <br>
  softly, slowly, talking to him, talking, talking, <br>
  while the man's leg hung over the lip of the next world<br>
  and the crowd gathered in the street, silent, and the<br>
  hairy net with its implacable grid was<br>
  unfolded near the curb and spread out and<br>
  stretched as the sheet is prepared to receive a birth. <br>
  Then they all came a little closer<br>
  where he squatted next to his death, his shirt<br>
  glowing its milky glow like something<br>
  growing in a dish at night in the dark in a lab and then<br>
  everything stopped<br>
  as his body jerked and he<br>
  stepped down from the parapet and went toward them<br>
  and they closed on him, I thought they were going to<br>
  beat him up, as a mother whose child has been<br>
  lost will scream at the child when its found, they<br>
  took him by the arms and held him up and<br>
  leaned him against the wall of the chimney and the<br>
  tall cop lit a cigarette<br>
  in his own mouth, and gave it to him, and<br>
  then they all lit cigarettes, and the<br>
  red, glowing ends burned like the<br>
  tiny campfires we lit at night<br>
  back at the beginning of the world. <br></span>

  <h3>Poem Written with Issa</h3>
  <i>Matthew Rohrer</i><br>
  <br>
  <span class="poem">A friend e-mails<br>
  how much are you<br>
  enjoying yourself? <br>
  a dripping faucet<br>
  loose cat litter<br>
  no doubt about it<br>
  a good world<br>
  is difficult I say<br>
  as if I were <br>
  tilling a field<br>
  ashamed of myself<br>
  I apologize<br>
  to the sleeping child<br></span>

  <h3>Introduction to Poetry</h3>
  <i>Billy Collins</i><br>
  <br>
  <span class="poem">
  I ask them to take a poem<br>
  and hold it up to the light<br>
  like a color slide<br>
  <br>
  or press an ear against its hive. <br>
  <br>
  I say drop a mouse into a poem<br>
  and watch him probe his way out, <br>
  or walk inside the poem’s room <br>
  and feel the walls for a light switch. <br>
  <br>
  I want them to waterski<br> 
  across the surface of a poem<br> 
  waving at the author’s name on the shore. <br> 
  <br>
  But all they want to do<br>
  is tie the poem to a chair with rope<br> 
  and torture a confession out of it. <br>  
  <br>
  They begin beating it with a hose<br>
  to find out what it really means.<br></span>
