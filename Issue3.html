	<h3>Breasts</h3>
	<i>Anne Pilling</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">
	They have done the state some service and they know it<br>
	suckled my boys, pleasured my man. <br>	
	Now they have to go under the knife. <br>
	<br>
	I’m being good to them, I’ve bought <br>
	fine cottons pricked with little flowers, <br>
	I bathe them in sweet oils and I no longer <br>
	sit like a hunchback cramming them from sight. <br>
	<br>
	Why in my fat-girl days did I wear bags<br>
	to hide their lovely roundness? Why did I <br>
	mound them with cushions on our old settee? <br>
	<br>
	In water they float out like lily pads<br>
	nippled with dark pink buds as this old river<br>
	creeps silently to its weir. Sad I’ve denied them, sad <br>
	how love, released, runs wild when it is too late<br> </span>

	<h3>‘Please?’</h3>
	<i>Vincent O’Sullivan</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">
	Saying ‘please’ isn’t enough, though<br>
	time and again they’ve said it, <br>
	her knowing how he’d rather<br>
	circuit to a script than rev up <br>
	from scratch, a new clutch <br>
	of words to fool the dark—so he’s like<br>  
	a man say just released from some<br>
	distant and scarcely dangerous<br>
	institution, who gets a lift<br>
	to town and buys a bunch of flowers, <br>
	flowers maybe for the first time,<br>
	and carries them, this beguiling torch<br>  
	in front of himself, thinking she’ll<br>
	know what it is he carries, a flare<br>
	that shows he travels a new road<br>
	for once, but she thinks as she sees<br>
	it surprising the night, why’s<br>
	he trying to light the road<br>
	he’s always been on? <br>
                        That’s how<br>
	different ‘please’ can be when<br>
	different people say it. A light<br>
	on the road. Or just more road. <br></span>

	<h3>My Troubles</h3>
	<i>Karina Borowicz</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">
	Maybe I’m just a symbol after all and I bite<br>
	my nails for my panic to be symbolized, I touch the prayer card<br>
	in my pocket thinking Mary, Mary, such white skin and bright<br>
	red lips, and that robe blue as the eternal<br>
	sky, the more you think about it the more fearsome<br>  
	eternity becomes, and I can’t look now<br>
	because there’s a glow on the horizon<br>
	behind her, that’s where all my troubles await. <br></span>

	<h3>Skater</h3>
	<i>Ted Kooser</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">
	She was all in black but for a yellow ponytail<br>
	that trailed from her cap, and bright blue gloves<br>
	that she held out wide, the feathery fingers spread, <br>
	as surely she stepped, click-clack, onto the frozen<br>
	top of the world. And there, with a clatter of blades, <br>  
	she began to braid a loose path that broadened<br>
	into a meadow of curls. Across the ice she swooped<br>
	and then turned back and, halfway, bent her legs<br>
	and leapt into the air the way a crane leaps, blue gloves<br>
	lifting her lightly, and turned a snappy half-turn<br>
	there in the wind before coming down, arms wide, <br>
	skating backward right out of that moment, smiling back<br>
	and the woman she’d been just an instant before. <br></span>

	<h3>A Pity. We Were Such a Good Invention</h3>
	<i> Yehuda Amichai </i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">
	They amputated<br>
	your thighs off my hips. <br>
	As far as I’m concerned<br>
	they are all surgeons. All of them. <br>
	<br>
	They dismantled us<br>
	each from the other. <br>
	As far as I’m concerned<br>
	they are all engineers. All of them. <br>
	<br>
	A pity. We were such a good<br>
	and loving invention. <br>
	An airplane made from a man and wife. <br>
	Wings and everything. <br>
	We hovered a little above the earth. <br>
	<br>
	We even flew a little.

	<h3>Short Talk On Hedonism</h3>
	<i>Anne Carson</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">
	beauty makes me hopeless. i don’t care<br>
	why anymore i just want to get away. <br>
	when i look at the city of paris i long<br>
	to wrap my legs around it. when i<br>
	watch you dancing there is a heartless<br>
	immensity like a sailor in a dead calm<br>
	sea. desires as round as peaches<br>
	bloom in me all night, i no longer<br>
	gather what falls. <br></span>

	<h3>Introduction to Poetry</h3>
	<i>Billy Collins</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">
	I ask them to take a poem<br>
	and hold it up to the light<br>
	like a color slide<br>
	<br>
	or press an ear against its hive. <br>
	<br>
	I say drop a mouse into a poem<br>
	and watch him probe his way out, <br>
	or walk inside the poem’s room <br>
	and feel the walls for a light switch. <br>
	<br>
	I want them to waterski<br> 
	across the surface of a poem<br> 
	waving at the author’s name on the shore. <br> 
	<br>
	But all they want to do<br>
	is tie the poem to a chair with rope<br> 
	and torture a confession out of it. <br> 	
	<br>
	They begin beating it with a hose<br>
	to find out what it really means.<br></span>
