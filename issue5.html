    <h3>The Quarrel</h3>
    <i>Diane DiPrima</i><br>
    <br>
    <span class="poem">You know I said to Mark I'm furious at you.<br>
    No he said are you bugged. He was drawing Brad who was asleep on the bed.<br>
    Yes I said I'm pretty god damned bugged. I sat down by the fire and stuck my feet out to warm them up.<br>
    Jesus I thought you think it's so easy. There you sit innocence personified. I didn't say anything else to him.<br>
    You know I thought I've got work to do too sometimes. In fact I probably have just as fucking much work to do as you. A piece of wood fell out of the fire and I poked it back in with my toe.<br>
    I am sick I said to the woodpile of doing dishes. I am just as lazy as you. Maybe lazier. The top of my shoe was scorched from the fire and I rubbed it where the suede was gone. <br>
    Just because I happen to be a chick I thought. <br>
    Mark finished one drawing and looked at it. Then he put it down and started another one. <br>
    It's damned arrogant of you I thought to assume that only you have things to do. Especially tonight. <br>
    And what a god damned concession it was for me to bother to tell you that I was bugged at all I said to the back of his neck. I didn't say it out loud. <br>
    I got up and went into the kitchen to do the dishes. And shit I thought I probably won't bother again. But I'll get bugged and not bother to tell you and after a while everything will be awful and I'll never say anything because it's so fucking uncool to talk about it. And that I thought will be that and what a shame. <br>
    Hey hon Mark yelled at me from the living room. It says here that Picasso produces fourteen hours a day. <br></span>

    <h3>Now That I am In Madrid I Can Think</h3>
    <i>Frank O’Hara</i><br>
    <br>
    <span class="poem">I think of you<br>
    and the continents brilliant and arid<br>
    and the slender heart you are sharing my share of with the American air<br>
    as the lungs I have felt sonorously subside slowly greet each morning<br>
    and your brown lashes flutter revealing two perfect dawns colored by New York<br> 
    see a vast bridge stretching to the humbled outskirts with only you<br>
    Standing on the edge of the purple like an only tree<br>
    and in Toledo the olive groves’ soft blue look at the hills with silver<br>
    like glasses like and old ladies hair<br>
    It’s well known that God and I don’t get along together<br>
    It’s just a view of the brass works for me, I don’t care about the Moors<br>
    seen through you the great works of death, you are greater<br>
    you are smiling, you are emptying the world so we can be alone. <br></span>

    <h3>Water Piece</h3>
    <i>Yoko Ono</i><br>
    <br>
    <span class="poem">
    Steal a moon on the water with a bucket. <br>
    Keep stealing until no moon is seen on <br>
    the water. <br></span>
