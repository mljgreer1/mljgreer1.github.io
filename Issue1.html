	<h3>Why I Left You</h3>
	<i>Selima Hill</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">When you had quite finished <br>
	dragging me across your bed <br>
	like a band of swaggering late-night removal men <br> 
	dragging a piano<br>
	the size and shape of the United States of America<br>
	across a tent,<br>
	I left the room, <br>
	and slipped into the garden,<br>
	where I gulped down whole mouthfuls of delicious aeroplanes<br>
	that taxied down my throat<br>
	still wrapped in sky<br>
	with rows of naked women in their bellies<br>
	telling me to go,<br>
	and I went,<br>
	and that’s why I did it,<br>
	and everything told me so – <br>
	tracks that I knew the meaning of <br>
	like the tracks of a wolf<br>
	wolf-hunters know the exact colour of<br>
	by the tracks of the tracks alone.<br>	
	You get a feeling for it.<br>
	You stand in the garden at night<br>
	with blood getting crisp on your thighs<br>
	and feel the stsrs spiralling right down<br>
	out of the sky into your ears<br>
	like drip-fed needles<br>
	saying <i>Get Out, Now</i>.<br>
	By ‘you’ I mean me.<br>
	One of us had to:<br>

    <h3>The Quarrel</h3>
    <i>Diane DiPrima</i><br>
    <br>
    <span class="poem">You know I said to Mark I'm furious at you.<br>
    No he said are you bugged. He was drawing Brad who was asleep on the bed.<br>
    Yes I said I'm pretty god damned bugged. I sat down by the fire and stuck my feet out to warm them up.<br>
    Jesus I thought you think it's so easy. There you sit innocence personified. I didn't say anything else to him.<br>
    You know I thought I've got work to do too sometimes. In fact I probably have just as fucking much work to do as you. A piece of wood fell out of the fire and I poked it back in with my toe.<br>
    I am sick I said to the woodpile of doing dishes. I am just as lazy as you. Maybe lazier. The top of my shoe was scorched from the fire and I rubbed it where the suede was gone. <br>
    Just because I happen to be a chick I thought. <br>
    Mark finished one drawing and looked at it. Then he put it down and started another one. <br>
    It's damned arrogant of you I thought to assume that only you have things to do. Especially tonight. <br>
    And what a god damned concession it was for me to bother to tell you that I was bugged at all I said to the back of his neck. I didn't say it out loud. <br>
    I got up and went into the kitchen to do the dishes. And shit I thought I probably won't bother again. But I'll get bugged and not bother to tell you and after a while everything will be awful and I'll never say anything because it's so fucking uncool to talk about it. And that I thought will be that and what a shame. <br>
    Hey hon Mark yelled at me from the living room. It says here that Picasso produces fourteen hours a day. <br></span>

	<h3>Spring Evening on Blind Mountain</h3>
	<i>Louise Erdrich</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">I won’t drink wine tonight<br>
	I want to hear what is going on<br>
	not in my own head<br>
	but all around me. <br>
	I sit for hours<br>	
	outside our house on Blind Mountain. <br>
	Below this scrap of yard<br>
	across the ragged old pasture, <br>
	two horses move<br>
	pulling grass into their mouths, tearing up<br>
	wildflowers by the roots. <br>
	They graze shoulder to shoulder. <br>
	Every night they lean together in sleep. <br>
	Up here, there is no one<br>
	for me to fail. <br>
	You are gone. <br>
	Our children are sleeping. <br>
	I don’t even have to write this down. <br></span>

	<h3>A Pity. We Were Such a Good Invention</h3>
	<i> Yehuda Amichai </i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">
	They amputated<br>
	your thighs off my hips. <br>
	As far as I’m concerned<br>
	they are all surgeons. All of them. <br>
	<br>
	They dismantled us<br>
	each from the other. <br>
	As far as I’m concerned<br>
	they are all engineers. All of them. <br>
	<br>
	A pity. We were such a good<br>
	and loving invention. <br>
	An airplane made from a man and wife. <br>
	Wings and everything. <br>
	We hovered a little above the earth. <br>
	<br>
	We even flew a little.
