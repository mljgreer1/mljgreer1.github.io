	<h3>Why I Left You</h3>
	<i>Selima Hill</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">When you had quite finished <br>
	dragging me across your bed <br>
	like a band of swaggering late-night removal men <br> 
	dragging a piano<br>
	the size and shape of the United States of America<br>
	across a tent,<br>
	I left the room, <br>
	and slipped into the garden,<br>
	where I gulped down whole mouthfuls of delicious aeroplanes<br>
	that taxied down my throat<br>
	still wrapped in sky<br>
	with rows of naked women in their bellies<br>
	telling me to go,<br>
	and I went,<br>
	and that’s why I did it,<br>
	and everything told me so – <br>
	tracks that I knew the meaning of <br>
	like the tracks of a wolf<br>
	wolf-hunters know the exact colour of<br>
	by the tracks of the tracks alone.<br>	
	You get a feeling for it.<br>
	You stand in the garden at night<br>
	with blood getting crisp on your thighs<br>
	and feel the stsrs spiralling right down<br>
	out of the sky into your ears<br>
	like drip-fed needles<br>
	saying <i>Get Out, Now</i>.<br>
	By ‘you’ I mean me.<br>
	One of us had to:<br>

	<h3>Man Cursing the Sea</h3>
	<i>Miroslav Holub</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">Someone<br>
	just climbed to the top of the cliff<br>
	and started cursing the sea:<br>
	<br>
	Stupid water, stupid pregnant water,<br>	
	slimy copy of the sky,<br>
	hesitant hoverer between the sun and the moon,<br>
	pettifogging reckoner of shells,<br>
	fluid, loud-mouthed bull,<br>
	fertilizing the rocks with his blood,<br> 
	suicidal sword<br>
	splintering itself on any promontory, <br>
	hydra, fragmenting the night,<br>
	breathing salty clouds of silence,<br>
	spreading jelly-like wings<br>
	in vain, in vain,<br>
	gorgon, devouring its own body,<br>
	<br>
	water, you absurd flat skull of water – <br>
	<br>
	Thus for a while he cursed the sea,<br>
	which licked his footprints in the sand like a wounded dog.<br>
	<br>
	And then he came down <br>
	and stroked<br>
	the small immense stormy mirror of the sea.<br>
	<br>
	There you are, water, he said, <br>
	and went his way.<br></span>

	<h3>Spring Evening on Blind Mountain</h3>
	<i>Louise Erdrich</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">I won’t drink wine tonight<br>
	I want to hear what is going on<br>
	not in my own head<br>
	but all around me. <br>
	I sit for hours<br>	
	outside our house on Blind Mountain. <br>
	Below this scrap of yard<br>
	across the ragged old pasture, <br>
	two horses move<br>
	pulling grass into their mouths, tearing up<br>
	wildflowers by the roots. <br>
	They graze shoulder to shoulder. <br>
	Every night they lean together in sleep. <br>
	Up here, there is no one<br>
	for me to fail. <br>
	You are gone. <br>
	Our children are sleeping. <br>
	I don’t even have to write this down. <br></span>

	<h3>Double Dutch</h3>
	<i>Gregory Pardlo</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">The girls turning double-dutch<br>
	bob & weave like boxers pulling<br>
	punches, shadowing each other, <br>
	sparring across the slack cord<br>	
	casting parabolas in the air. They<br>
	whip quick as an infant’s pulse<br>
	and the jumper, before she<br>
	enters the winking, nods in time<br>
	as if she has a notion to share, <br>
	waiting her chance to speak. But she’s<br>
	anticipating the upbeat<br>
	like a bandleader counting off<br>
	the tune they are about to swing into. <br>
	The jumper stair-steps into mid-air<br>
	as if she’s jumping rope in low-gravity, <br>
	training for a lunar mission. Airborne a moment<br>
	long enough to fit a second thought in, <br>
	she looks caught in the mouth bones of a fish<br>
	as she flutter-floats into motion<br>
	like a figure in a stack of time-lapse photos<br>
	thumbed alive. Once inside, <br>
	the bells tied to her shoestrings rouse the gods<br>
	who’ve lain in the dust since the Dutch<br>
	acquired Manhattan. How she dances<br>
	patterns like a dust-heavy bee retracing<br>
	its travels in scale before the hive. How<br>
	the whole stunning contraption of girl and rope<br>
	slaps and scoops like a paddle boat. <br>
	Her misted skin arranges the light<br>
	with each adjustment and flex. Now heather-<br>
	hued, now sheen, light listing on the fulcrum<br>
	of a wrist and the bare jutted joints of elbow<br>
	and knee, and the faceted surfaces of muscle, <br>
	surfaces fracturing and reforming<br>
	like a sun-tickled sleeve of running water.<br>
	She makes jewelry of herself and garlands<br>
	the ground with shadows.<br></span>

	<h3>Summer Solstice, New York City</h3>
	<i>Sharon Olds</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">By the end of the longest day of the year he could not stand it, <br>
	he went up the iron stairs through the roof of the building<br>
	and over the soft, tarry surface<br>
	to the edge, put one leg over the complex green tin cornice<br>
	and said if they came a step closer that was it. <br>
	Then the huge machinery of the earth began to work for his life, <br>
	the cops came in their suits blue-grey as the sky on a cloudy evening, <br>
	and one put on a bullet-proof vest, a<br>
	black shell around his own life, <br>
	life of his children's father, in case<br>
	the man was armed, and one, slung with a<br>
	rope like the sign of his bounden duty, <br>
	came up out of a hole in the top of the neighboring building<br>
	like the gold hole they say is in the top of the head, <br>
	and began to lurk toward the man who wanted to die. <br>
	The tallest cop approached him directly, <br>
	softly, slowly, talking to him, talking, talking, <br>
	while the man's leg hung over the lip of the next world<br>
	and the crowd gathered in the street, silent, and the<br>
	hairy net with its implacable grid was<br>
	unfolded near the curb and spread out and<br>
	stretched as the sheet is prepared to receive a birth. <br>
	Then they all came a little closer<br>
	where he squatted next to his death, his shirt<br>
	glowing its milky glow like something<br>
	growing in a dish at night in the dark in a lab and then<br>
	everything stopped<br>
	as his body jerked and he<br>
	stepped down from the parapet and went toward them<br>
	and they closed on him, I thought they were going to<br>
	beat him up, as a mother whose child has been<br>
	lost will scream at the child when its found, they<br>
	took him by the arms and held him up and<br>
	leaned him against the wall of the chimney and the<br>
	tall cop lit a cigarette<br>
	in his own mouth, and gave it to him, and<br>
	then they all lit cigarettes, and the<br>
	red, glowing ends burned like the<br>
	tiny campfires we lit at night<br>
	back at the beginning of the world. <br></span>

	<span class="poem">A friend e-mails<br>
	how much are you<br>
	enjoying yourself? <br>
	a dripping faucet<br>
	loose cat litter<br>
	no doubt about it<br>
	a good world<br>
	is difficult I say<br>

	<h3>The Quarrel</h3>
	<i>Diane DiPrima</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">You know I said to Mark I'm furious at you.<br>
	No he said are you bugged. He was drawing Brad who was asleep on the bed.<br>
	Yes I said I'm pretty god damned bugged. I sat down by the fire and stuck my feet out to warm them up.<br>
	Jesus I thought you think it's so easy. There you sit innocence personified. I didn't say anything else to him.<br>
	You know I thought I've got work to do too sometimes. In fact I probably have just as fucking much work to do as you. A piece of wood fell out of the fire and I poked it back in with my toe.<br>
	I am sick I said to the woodpile of doing dishes. I am just as lazy as you. Maybe lazier. The top of my shoe was scorched from the fire and I rubbed it where the suede was gone. <br>
	Just because I happen to be a chick I thought. <br>
	Mark finished one drawing and looked at it. Then he put it down and started another one. <br>
	It's damned arrogant of you I thought to assume that only you have things to do. Especially tonight. <br>
	And what a god damned concession it was for me to bother to tell you that I was bugged at all I said to the back of his neck. I didn't say it out loud. <br>
	I got up and went into the kitchen to do the dishes. And shit I thought I probably won't bother again. But I'll get bugged and not bother to tell you and after a while everything will be awful and I'll never say anything because it's so fucking uncool to talk about it. And that I thought will be that and what a shame. <br>
	Hey hon Mark yelled at me from the living room. It says here that Picasso produces fourteen hours a day. <br></span>

	<h3>Now That I am In Madrid I Can Think</h3>
	<i>Frank O’Hara</i><br>
	<br>
	<span class="poem">I think of you<br>
	and the continents brilliant and arid<br>
	and the slender heart you are sharing my share of with the American air<br>
	as the lungs I have felt sonorously subside slowly greet each morning<br>
	and your brown lashes flutter revealing two perfect dawns colored by New York<br> 
	see a vast bridge stretching to the humbled outskirts with only you<br>
	Standing on the edge of the purple like an only tree<br>
	and in Toledo the olive groves’ soft blue look at the hills with silver<br>
	like glasses like and old ladies hair<br>
	It’s well known that God and I don’t get along together<br>
 	It’s just a view of the brass works for me, I don’t care about the Moors<br>
	seen through you the great works of death, you are greater<br>
	you are smiling, you are emptying the world so we can be alone. <br></span>
